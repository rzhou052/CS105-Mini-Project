    "For this project, we designed and conducted a survey targeting students from CS105, CS111, and CS010C classes to examine their caffeine consumption. Our objective was to gain insight into their daily habits, and to see if we could extrapolate any interesting conclusions from our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is our data about?\n",
    "\n",
    "Our data focuses on students' caffeine consumption and its relationship to their lifestyle and health habits. It includes information on how frequently students consume caffeine, their preferred sources (such as coffee, energy drinks, or tea), and additional factors like sleep patterns, energy levels throughout the day, and other health-related behaviors. By analyzing this data, we aim to uncover connections between caffeine use and students' overall well-being, examining how it influences their sleep quality, daily energy levels, and possibly other health impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What would we like to know about our data?\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to learn how caffeine consumption affects students' daily routines, particularly regarding their sleep quality, energy levels, and overall health. By examining the frequency and sources of caffeine intake, along with lifestyle factors like sleep habits and other health behaviors, we hope to identify patterns that may reveal how caffeine influences students' physical and mental well-being. Additionally, we want to see if there are any notable trends among students in terms of their dependency on caffeine for focus and energy, helping us better understand the potential impacts of caffeine on their academic and personal lives."
